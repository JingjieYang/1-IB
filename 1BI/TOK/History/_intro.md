# An Introduction to EPISTEMOLOGY
## What is Epistemology?
Epistemology, or theory of knowledge, is that branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of knowledge, its possibility, scope and general basis.

## AIM
Epistemology attempts to provide a general basis which would __ the possibility of knowledge.

## What does it mean?
Philosophers question the very basis of our knowledge and wonder how certain can we be of anything we think we know ...

| Things we DO know \*WHY | Things we THINK we know \*WHY| Things we DON'T know \*WHY|
|-------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|
|My name                  | | |
|WWI DATES (1914-1918)| | |
|I'm alive| | |
|I'm here right now| | |

`FACT`: something that can be verified as true / false

**History**: 

- WHAT happened
	- facts
	- can be verified
	- is 100% objective / safe
- WHY it happened
	- based on interpretations
	-  = explanations
	-  contains subjectivity

# TOK History
## History
History is a reconstruction of the **past** carried out by professional historians on the basis of *available* **evidence** (= sources) in order to understand what exactly happened and why.

## Where is the subjective element?
HISTORIANS write about 

- **WHAT** happened in the past
	- ingredients: eggs, flour, butter, sugar, chocolate
	- BEDROCK of history
	- _Objective_: SAME FACTS
- **WHY** it happened
	- recipe
		- new ingredients (i.e. milk, almond powder) = new document
		- How hot oven is
		- quantity of ingredient = importance of given to each factor / cause
	- one element of _subjectivity_: why / how

## The CAKE exercise
- Aesthetic judgement
	- ≠ anesthetic
	- value / appealing to some feeling

is a _construction_.  
So is _History_. (subjectivity, choices)

- Can a cake be "FAKE"?
	- (Do "fake news" count as news / fact?)
- Can a cake be _unreliable_?
- Do you distrust a cake?

## What shapes a historian's perspective?

`2017-09-25`
# To What extent is "perspective" a challenge in History?
- to be handed in 16th Oct
- Subjectivity vs objectivity
- perspective: _filter_(s) that shape(s) our understanding of Reality
- encompasses bias = negative (prejudice)
- comes from biological components (e.g. senses, gender)

## Ted Cruz campaign
- Behavioural Science
    - Psycho-graphics
    - OCEAN Model
        - all anxious people
        - all outgoing people
    - drawing up "psychological" profile or personality MODELS
    - vs. demographics = 'all women', 'all retired people', etc.
    - or geographics = 'all Italians'
- BIG DATA Analytics = using DATA  to target audience
    - which message for which audience
    - = aggregation of thousands of individual data
    - e.g. Netflix, Amazon, Google, etc.
    - 4,000 or 5,000 data on **each** American

=> perspective

## Where do problems in History come from?
### _SOURCES_
- they are _one-sided_ / reliability
- understanding them: lack of context
- _NOT enough_
- _too MANY_

### _HISTORIAN_
- multiple _perspectives_
- their way of _SELECTING_

- e.g. Nanking incident vs Rape of Nanking / Nanking massacre
- e.g. Middle Ages: clergyman wrote historical records, giving impression that the period is religious

## The Role of Selection in History
History is always a selection.  
Historians choose which events to study.  
Write about = historical events are those that had great impact on manny people  
They choose which aspect to study of what sources to use.  
They choose which questions they answer & how.  
This is where the subjectivity of the historian matters!
