# Power Rules
$$x^a \cdot x^b = x^{a+b}$$
$$(x^a y^b)^n = x^{a n} y^{b n}$$

## Example
Solve for x in $2^{x^2} \cdot 4^{2x} = 32$

S = {-5; 1}

## Example (EXTREME DIFFICULTY)
Solve for x in $2^{x^2} \cdot 4^{2x} = 35$

$x = $

# Algebra vs PITA (LQLA)
Letters in the Question, Letters in the Answer choices

1. Plug in numbers for letters in the question  
note: we must agree with the conditions of the problem
    - $x = 3$
2. Solve the problem using the numbers from step 1. Circle your answer.
    - $\frac{2 \cdot 3 - 2}{3^2 - 1} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}$
3. Plug the numbers from step 1 into each answer choice.
    - ~~A. 2~~ B. 1/2 ~~C. 2/9~~ ~~D. 2/2~~
4. Eliminate choices that do not give you circled from step 2.

**Note**: If more than one choice remains, return to step 1 and plug in new number to use on the remaining choices

## Systems
### (I) Elimination
### (II) Substitution

$$3x + 5y = 7$$
$$10x + 2y = 3$$

# Misc
- "A less than B": B - A
- "A is less than B": A < B

## Linear vs Exponential vs Quadratic
- `linear`: $y = mx + b$
- `exponential`: $y = a^x$
- `quadratic`: $a x^2 + b x + c$
